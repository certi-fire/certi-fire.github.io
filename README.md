Organizations risk losing revenue, customers, and reputation, and exposing internal or customer data to attackers if they do not properly manage Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates. TLS (successor of SSL / also called SSL) is the most widely used security protocol to secure web transactions and other communications on the internet and internal networks. TLS server certificates are central to the security and operation of internet-facing and internal web services. Improper TLS server certificate management results in significant outages to web applications and services—such as government services, online banking, flight operations, and mission-critical services within an organization—and increased risk of security breaches. Organizations should ensure that TLS server certificates are properly managed to avoid these issues. Certificate management is the process of purchasing, deploying, renewing, and replacing certificates on their respective endpoints (Ex: application, server, devices, or network components). A well-defined certificate management strategy is invaluable to organizations in the long run since the increased visibility and control over their infrastructures helps them prevent application downtime and outages which are caused due to faulty, misconfigured, or expired certificates.
